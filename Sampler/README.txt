Environment:
I am currently working in a Visual Studio Code environment on Windows 10 as that is what the instructor was using. I got my reposotories connected to my desktop, and have been pulling and pushing request on github as I made strides in this project. I havent been using the github application for windows 10 as I found it to be clunky, and decided to memorize the few commands to avoid it altogether.

Implementation:
Created an array of sounds, saved as variables pulled from MP3 files in my assets folder. Imported libraries from cloudflare website. My synthesizer only works if you hold down the slider when using it.
