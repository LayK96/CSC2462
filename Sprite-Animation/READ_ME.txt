Environment:
I am running a p5 module downloaded on my Mac. I am using Atom.io, the text
editor from Github. I am using a package called "Atom-Live-Server" in order to run a local server on my machine that I then view in Google Chrome. I use chrom because the developer tools with javascript allows me to troubleshoot from the console as well as disable browser caching so I can see everything I type in my javascript file without having to refresh.

Implementation:
Starting off with this project I wanted to get the basic fundamentals of getting a walking sprite, so I initially had him walking in a loop. Then I created if/else statements to catch key inputs (spefically the "a", "d", and "LEFT-SHIFT" key). If you press and hold the "a" key, my sprite will walk left. If you press and hold the "d" key, my sprite will walk right. If you are walking the sprite, and press and hold "Left-Shift", he will start crawling. After I got that working I just copied and pasted the code, and made new asset files for a new sprite. I got tired of them walking on the same white background, so I cropped two photos of 2d environments together and gave them something to walk on. I was going to make it a rolling/running background, but it got to complex and I decided to move on. Uploaded to Github (link above) and tested it. On to the next Project!
