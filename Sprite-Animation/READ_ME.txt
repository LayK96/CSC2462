Environment:
I am currently working in a Visual Studio Code environment on Windows 10 as that is what the instructor was using. I got my reposotories connected to my desktop, and have been pulling and pushing request on github as I made strides in this project. I havent been using the github application for windows 10 as I found it to be clunky, and decided to memorize the few commands to avoid it altogether.

Implementation:
Starting off with this project I wanted to get the basic fundamentals of getting a walking sprite, so I initially had him walking in a loop. Then I created if/else statements to catch key inputs (spefically the "a", "d", and "LEFT-SHIFT" key). If you press and hold the "a" key, my sprite will walk left. If you press and hold the "d" key, my sprite will walk right. If you are walking the sprite, and press and hold "Left-Shift", he will start crawling. After I got that working I just copied and pasted the code, and made new asset files for a new sprite. I got tired of them walking on the same white background, so I cropped two photos of 2d environments together and gave them something to walk on. I was going to make it a rolling/running background, but it got to complex and I decided to move on. Uploaded to Github (link above) and tested it. On to the next Project!
