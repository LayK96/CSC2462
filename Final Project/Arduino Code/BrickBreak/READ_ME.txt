For my final project, I wanted to implement a touch screen for a few reason. First, I hate having to work with wires for buttons, as you have to have power in, then resistors and ground out. Second, I wanted to work on practicing with a cool touch screen with a library I found built into Arduino. And the final reason, was because I had this laying around from when I made a pokemon emulator.

Setup: It is an Arduino Mega 2560 and a 1.7 inch touch screen, I can't remember the brand or model number. I built a small cardboard housing with tape to hold the battery and board. and punched a notch for the speaker to make noise through.

Code: For my code, I included the libraries manually in Arduino going to Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries -> Search and install the necessary ones. It was easy and left me with one clean INO file. I found a premade sound header file that I used to have a long list of sounds. Went through and modified a couple to have resources for my project.
