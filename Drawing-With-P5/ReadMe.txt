I set up a P5 environment on my Macbook. I used a command to install p5 and all of it's
libraries. I downloaded Atom.io text editor (Github's editor) as I can use a package 
called "Atom-Live-Server" to run a server locally on my computer. I am using Google
Chrome as I can open a javascript console to see my code and errors when necessary, as 
well as being able to disable caching to ensure eveyrything in my browser is updated
from the server.

This folder contains 4 examples of code for the project "Drawing with P5"

Example 1:
A green canvas with 2 shapes, this project is an intro into learning how to use the
references from the P5 website in order to draw and place shapes on a canvas.

Example 2:
A triple venn diagram with 3 circles used to focus on placement as well as blending colors
using the RGB color scale built into p5

Example 3: 
An illustration of Pacman and Blinky (red ghost) from the game, this example is more
practice for placement as well as stacking objects in P5

Example 4:
This example is a picture of a red star on a green circle, which is testing your
creativity within P5. I was going to make a function to draw a circle, but could
not get it working, so I switched to the "beginShape()" function which allows you
to draw a shape by placing points on the canvas and filling it. Also we used a new function
that creates an outline around a shape called stroke() and strokeWeight().
